<p> The following timeseries plots show various aspects of internet attention to Obama and/or Romney from March 1, 2012, to June 30, 2012.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><b> Internet attention to Obama (blue) and Romney (red) averaged over all states. </b></p>
<pre>          The two big peaks you see in the blue Obama line below correspond to when he announced his support of gay marriage and the recent health care supreme court decision. The other peaks correspond to other big events for the candidates, which I am starting to explore. </pre>

<br><br>

<p> <b> Internet attention separated by state for Obama (a), Romney (b), and both candidates plotted together for comparison (c). </b> </p> <br>
<pre>          Usually when a state has an unusual peak it is due to a candidate (or first lady) visiting the state, or due to a bunch of articles concerning the candidate and the state. </pre>

<pre>          The outlier (cyan line) in the per-state Romney data below is Utah. Utah internet people really like Romney.</pre>

<p><b> Internet attention separated into blue states, red states, purple states for Obama (a), Romney (b), and both candidates plotted together for comparison (c). </b></p>
<pre>          Data for which states are considered blue/red/purple was grabbed from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states#Current_classification">here</a>. </pre>
<p>(a)</p>

<pre>          It's somewhat interesting in the plot below that at a number of peaks in the graph, Romney gets more attention from blue states. The equivalent holds true for Obama on some (but fewer) peaks in the graph above.</pre>
<p>(b)</p>

<p> Difference between Obama and Romney internet attention (given by Obama minus Romney i.e. positive values are when Obama attention > Romney attention, and negative values when Romney attention > Obama attention)</p>
<pre>          Romney is briefly ahead of Obama for the first time around June 23, 2012, but Obama gains the lead again as the supreme court healthcare decision picks up.</pre>

<p><b> Candidate's websites clicks for Obama (blue line) and Romney (red line). </b></p>
<pre>          barackobama.com vs mittromney.com. One biasing factor we need to be weary of is that Mitt Romney has a custom domain via bitly (mi.tt) which directs to mittromney.com, which might cause the romney people to publish more bitly links, and therefore get more clicks. Anyways, this shows that, at least through bitly links, romney's website is getting more views. </pre>
