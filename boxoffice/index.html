<h1>Bitly Box Office Predictions</h1>

<big> Predicting opening weekend film gross with bitly data. </big>
<br><br><br>
We set out to see if the amount of attention a movie receives on the social web is correlated with its box office take. Using bitly data as a sensor for attention, we explored various features of our data set to try and predict the opening weekend gross of films.
<br><br>
<!--<big><b>Data:</b></big>-->
<!--<br><br>-->
<!--The following graph shows a timeseries of the number of saved links with content related to Men in Black 3, for each hour around its release on May 25, 2012.-->
For example, the following graph shows how the attention toward a major film release--Men in Black 3--increases around the data of its release. You can see a clear rise in attention in the week preceding the opening. We're able to monitor this because, as attention towards a movie grows, so does the number of saved links containing content related to the movie.

<br><br><br><br>
<!--As attention towards a movie grows, so does the number of saved links containing content related to the movie. The following graph shows the timeseries of saved-links-per-hour for a few summer blockbusters.-->
And this increase in attention is not an isolated incident! With all major releases we can see a clear rise in attention preceding the release, followed by a corresponding decrease in attention (as we see below for a few summer blockbusters). Most notably, larger releases garner larger attention. So how do we capture this information to actually predict the box office results?
<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>
<big><b>Features for supervised learning:</b></big>
<br><br>
We would like to derive features from the timeseries signal for use in supervised learning. The following are a collection of features that we can compute from this signal or from prior information about a movie:
<br><br>
<b>Total Saves:</b> the sum of saves over all hours in the timeseries in a window prior to the release.<br><br>
<b>Peak Saves:</b> the maximum number of saves over all hours in the timeseries in a window prior to the release.<br><br>
<b>First Fourier Coefficient:</b> the first coefficient of the fourier transform of the timeseries in a window prior to the release.<br><br>
<b>Timeseries Slope:</b> the slope of the line formed by the two endpoints of the timeseries over a window prior to the release.<br><br>
<b>Theater Count:</b> the number of theaters where a movie plays. <br><br>
The following plots show the relationship between each pair of features, along with the opening weekend gross, for a training set of 65 movies.

<br><br><br><br>
We must select a window of time over which we will derive features from the timeseries. We would like this window to end long enough prior to the release to make and/or publish predictions about the opening weekend gross; it is unclear how long before the release the window should start.
<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>
The following plots show a single feature plotted against weekend movie gross for a range of timeseries windows. The plot areas are shaded by the r-squared coefficient of determination of the plotted points. The plots show that attention towards a movie is most predictive of opening weekend gross when taken over a window that starts 3-7 days before the release and ends 1 day before the release.

<br><br><br><br>
To make more accurate predictions about the opening weekend gross of a given movie, we would like to identify other movies that show a similar pattern of interest. To accomplish this, we define a distance between pairs of timeseries to employ the $k$-nearest-neighbor algorithm. The distance between two timeseries, $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$, is defined to be: <br><br>
\[
D(s_{1},s_{2}) = \sum_{t} \frac{ s_{1}(t) - s_{2}(t) } { \text{max}(\sum s_{1}, \sum s_{2}) } 
\]
<br><br>
where $t$ ranges over each time-point in the timeseries window, $s(t)$ denotes the timeseries value at time $t$, and $\sum s$ denotes the sum over all values in the timeseries. This distance metric yields a lower value if two timeseries are of a similar scale and if they have simliar shapes.
<br><br>
We incorporate the results of the $k$-nearest-neighbors algorithm as an additional feature for a given film, by computing the inverse-distance weighted average of the opening weekend gross for each of its $k$ neighbors. The following plots show the results of nearest neighbors for two films when $k=3$.

<br><br><br><br>
<big><b>Model:</b></big>
<br><br>
We choose a linear model for prediction, and perform 10-fold cross-validation on all subsets of features to carry out feature subset selection. The resulting model has the form:
<br><br>
$y = c_{1}x_{1} + c_{2}x_{2} + c_{3}x_{3} + c_{4}x_{4} + c_{5}x_{5}$
<br><br>
where $x_{1}$ is the first fourier coefficient, $x_{2}$ is the timeseries slope, $x_{3}$ is the total number of saves, $x_{4}$ is the weighted nearest neighbor average, and $x_{5}$ is the theater count.
<br><br><br><br>
<big><b>Predictions:</b></big>
<br><br>
We've trained our model on a training set of 65 movies in 2012 and used it to predict the opening weekend gross for a test set of five recent movies:<br> Seeking a Friend for the End of the World, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, Magic Mike, Madea's Witness Protection, and People Like Us.
<br><br>
We compare our results with the true opening weekend gross of these  movies, along with predictions made by the Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX), a web-based game and prediction market where visitors buy and sell virtual shares of celebrities and movies. The HSX uses the values of shares to make predictions of movie openings.

<br><br><br><br>
<big><b>Future:</b></big>
<br><br>
Currently, predictions are made almost solely using features derived from bitly data; only theater count is incorporated as an additional piece of external information. To increase the accuracy of predictions, features such as the rating, genre, and reviews of movies could be incorporated into the model.
