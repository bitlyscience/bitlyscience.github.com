<big> Predicting opening weekend film gross with bitly data. </big>
<br><br><br>
This project aims to predict the opening weekend gross of movies using features derived from bitly data. The following graph shows a timeseries containing the saved-links-per-hour around the release of Men in Black 3, which occured on May 25, 2012.

As attention towards a movie grows, so does the number of saved links with content related to the movie. The following graph shows the timeseries of saved-links-per-hour for a few summer blockbusters.

<big><b>Features for supervised learning:</b></big>
<br><br>
We would like to derive features from the timeseries signal for use in supervised learning. The following are a collection of features that we can compute from this signal or from prior information about a movie:
<br><br>
<b>Total Saves:</b> the sum of the saves that make up the timeseries in a window prior to the release.<br><br>
<b>Peak Saves:</b> the sum of the saves that make up the timeseries in a window prior to the release.<br><br>
<b>First Fourier Coefficient:</b> the first coefficient of the fourier transform of the timeseries.<br><br>
<b>Timeseries Slope:</b> the slope of the line formed by the two endpoints of the timeseries over a window prior to the release.<br><br>
<b>Theater Count:</b> the number of theaters where a movie plays. <br>

<br><br><br><br>
We must select a window of time over which we will derive features from the timeseries. We would like this window to end long enough prior to the release to make and/or publish predictions about the opening weekend gross; it is unclear how long before the release the window should start.

The following plots show a single feature plotted against weekend movie gross for a range of timeseries windows. The plot areas are shaded by the r-squared coefficient of determination of the plotted points.

<br><br><br><br>
We also define a distance between timeseries to employ the nearest neighbor algorithm. Additionally, we incorporate nearest neighbor as a feature.
<br><br><br><br>
We perform k-fold cross-validation on all permutations of features to select the most predictive subset.
